## Building still, I guess

Technically inclined toward systems that resist explanation.  
Focused on implicit coherence, layered environments, and the fine line between intention and accident.

Previously contributed to recursive tooling initiatives and the soft architecture of uncertainty. Occasionally involved in digital rituals, usually after hours.

### Philosophy

Structure is useful. Until it isn't.  
Clean code is a mood, not a metric.

### When not coding

Tuning systems until they hum â€” or stop humming entirely.  
Occasionally seen squinting at terminal logs, looking for meaning.  
Still unsure if the architecture is elegant or just inevitable.
